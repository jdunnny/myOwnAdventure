	She has been recorded to responding to a coded radio station from her flat and tattoo shop Steel and Stencils in Williamsborg, Brooklyn. No details to what the coded radio station has said with this call or what is it referring to have come forward. 

	She also has been seen to be marked with what officials have said is the I.C.A.R.U.S signiture (see pic. 4). Holt having her own studio could be behind the marking and thus a sympathizer and potential informant with information regarding her connection to Hominum Bionics Inc.
